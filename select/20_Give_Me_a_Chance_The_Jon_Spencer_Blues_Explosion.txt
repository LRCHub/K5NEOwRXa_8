Well so late at night
Clawing to the cupboard you're busting a fight
I'm gonna draw you close
I'm gonna hold you near
I'm gonna get ya alright

Ah! I'm gonna love you
Give me a chance
Give me a chance

When everybody's trying to put you down
Straight don't dis all in your face
I'm gonna run straight home
I'm gonna hurry up
I got to get myself a back door ramp
Yeah! I'm gonna love you

Give me a chance
'Cause I'm a rock and roll dad
Give me a chance

I get paralyzed
I'm so scared baby
I gotta try
How can I help
Oh no I can't help myself
I realize I got nothing to hide
You and me
Oh that's all right

Yeah, oh do it
I said ml, no ne,b;;;ver
Well if you give me a chance
I'll do all that I can
I'm gonna ditch it all just for you
Ah!
I'm gonna love you

Give me a chance
I'm gonna do it
That's right baby
Come on, do it

Give me a chance
Give me a chance
Give me a chance
Give me a chance
