Give me a minute
Just one will do
I'll say goodbye, to gossamer skies
The city will move out of frame
But it's still you
Who remains
Give me a minute
Kiss me again
I'll say goodbye, to cloudy blue skies
I'd trade all I got in my name
For you instead
Of this pain
Maybe it's time to forget you
Maybe it's time to throw dirt upon your name
Or place blame
But it's no one's fault
No it's no one's fault
We're just late
I'll give you a minute
Let you have peace
I'll say farewell, to what I can't tell
I bet that you'll do just the same
And maybe I'm
What remains
