Honey, just one sweet kiss
Baby, from your sweet lips
Honey, just one sweet kiss
Baby, from your sweet lips

That's all I want
That's all I need
I'm satisfied

Honey, just one of your smiles
To know, it makes it all worthwhile
Honey, just of one a your smiles
To know, it makes it all worthwhile

That's all I want
That's all I need
I'm satisfied

We could go walkin' down the lane
Together, hand in hand
But if you think, it's gonna rain
We'll stay at home, an' listen to the band

Baby, just one of your kisses
Right-a from your sweet lips
Baby, just want your sweet kiss
Right-a from your sweet lips

That's all I want
That's all I need
I'm satisfied

Doo doo doo doo doo...

We could go walkin' down the lane (swop-swop, swop-swop)
Together hand in hand (swop-swop, swop-swop)

But if you think it's gonna rain (swop-swop, swop-swop)
Stay at home and listen to the band (do-wop, do-wop, do-wop)

A baby, just one sweet kiss
Honey, honey, honey from your sweet lips
Baby, just one sweet smile
That makes ev'rything worth while

That's all I want
That's all I need
I'm satisfied

That's all I want
That's all I need
I'm satisfied
